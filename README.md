# ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Search Scoring API (FastAPI)

This is a lightweight API built with **FastAPI** that allows you to fetch the **top 3 most relevant YouTube videos** for a given search query â€” based on a custom relevance formula using views and age of video.

## ðŸ§  Scoring Formula

Each video is scored using:

```bash
score = views - (1.01 ^ days_old)
```

This favors high-view videos that are also more recent.
