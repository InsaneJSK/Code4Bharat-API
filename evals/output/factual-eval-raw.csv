This intermediation means that the shoe maker can sell shoes for money and buy wheat without the farmer needing to want shoes. Thus, money simplifies trade by removing the dependency on mutual exchange of specific goods.","In a barter system where goods are directly exchanged without the use of money, double coincidence of wants is an essential feature.

It is also involved in the formation of lysosomes and the synthesis of complex sugars. If a cell lacked a Golgi apparatus:

1. **Impaired Cellular Secretion**: The cell would be unable to properly package and transport molecules to their destinations, disrupting secretion and communication.

2. **Lysosome Dysfunction**: Without the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, which are essential for breaking down cellular waste, would not form correctly, leading to an accumulation of toxins and potential cell damage.

3. **Disruption of Membrane System**: The Golgi apparatus works in conjunction with the ER. Without it, the ER's products wouldn't be processed, affecting protein modification and transport.

Overall, the absence of the Golgi apparatus would severely impair cellular function, leading to growth issues and potentially cell death.

'People as a resource' refers to the concept where a nation's population is viewed as a valuable asset rather than a burden. This perspective emphasizes the potential of the population to contribute positively to the economy through their skills, abilities, and productivity.

Thus, investing in education, healthcare, and skill development transforms people into a productive resource, benefiting both individuals and society.","People as Resource’ is a way of referring to a country's working people in terms of their existing productive skills and abilities.

If we use the mole fraction of a gas in\nthe solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be\nsaid that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is\nproportional to the partial pressure of the gas over\nthe solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s\nlaw states that “the partial pressure of the gas in\nvapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction\nof the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:\np = KH x\n(1.11)\nHere KH is the Henry’s law constant.

Mathematically, it is expressed as:

p = KH * x

Where:
- \( p \) is the partial pressure of the gas in the vapor phase.
- \( x \) is the mole fraction of the gas in the solution.
- \( KH \) is Henry's law constant.",The solubility of a gas in a liquid at a particular temperature is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas in equilibrium with the liquid at that temperature is called Henry's Law,1.0,0.9242281074612181,0.499999999975,1.0
